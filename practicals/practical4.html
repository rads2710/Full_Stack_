    <h2 >About Course</h2>
    <p>Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application. Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript portion of web site production as opposed to the database on server-side programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various different browsers, devices and screen sizes.</p>
